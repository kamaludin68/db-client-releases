This repository hosts the website and the downloadable builds. To report a
bug or ask for a feature, [open an issue](https://github.com/kamaludin68/db-client-releases/issues).

> Preview release. The builds are not yet signed, so Windows and macOS warn
> you the first time you open the app (see [Install](#install)).

## Features

- **SQL editor with autocomplete.** Suggests tables, columns, schemas and
  keywords from your live schema, resolves aliases, and quotes names
  correctly for each database. Ctrl+N (Cmd+N) opens a new editor.
- **Database navigator.** Schemas, tables, views, functions, sequences and
  more, in a tree grouped like DBeaver.
- **Edit data in the grid.** Change cells, add and delete rows, review the
  changes, then save them in one transaction or revert.
- **Table inspector.** Data preview with an adjustable row limit (20 by
  default), columns, constraints, indexes, triggers and DDL.
- **Schema editing.** Dialogs for columns, constraints, indexes and triggers
  that show the SQL before it runs (PostgreSQL).
- **Export.** Results as CSV, TSV, JSON, Markdown or SQL INSERT statements.
- **MongoDB.** A Compass-style document view with an expandable JSON tree;
  edit documents in mongosh syntax and only the changed fields are saved.
- **Redis.** Key browser for strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets and
  streams, plus a command console.
- **Private by design.** The app connects straight to your database.
  Passwords are kept in the system keychain (Keychain, Windows Credential
  Locker, libsecret).
- **Themes.** VS Code Dark, GitHub Dark, Dracula and VS Code Light.

### macOS 12 or later (Apple silicon and Intel)

1. Download `db-client-macos.zip`, unpack it and drag **DB Client** into
